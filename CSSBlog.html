<div class="firstp">Under thy conduct, and in dreadful deeds 130 Fearless, endangered heaven’s perpetual king;
And put to proof his high supremacy,
Whether upheld by strength, or chance, or fate,
Too well I see and rue the dire event,
That with sad overthrow and foul defeat
Hath lost us heaven, and all this mighty host
In horrible destruction laid thus low,
As far as gods and heavenly essences
Can perish: for the mind and spirit remains</div>	
<div>Invincible, and vigour soon returns, 140 Though all our glory extinct, and happy state
Here swallowed up in endless misery.
But what if he our conqueror (whom I now
Of force believe almighty, since no less
Than such could have o’erpowered such force as ours) Have left us this our spirit and strength entire
Strongly to suffer and support our pains,
That we may so suffice his vengeful ire,
Or do him mightier service as his thralls</div>	
<div>By right of war, whate’er his business be 150 Here in the heart of hell to work in fire,
Or do his errands in the gloomy deep;
What can it then avail though yet we feel
Strength undiminished, or eternal being</div>

<div class="firstp">But ever to do ill our sole delight, 160 As being the contrary to his high will
Whom we resist. If then his providence
Out of our evil seek to bring forth good, Our labour must be to pervert that end,
And out of good still to find means of evil;</div>	
<div>Which oft-times may succeed, so as perhaps Shall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb His inmost counsels from their destined aim. But see the angry victor hath recalled
His ministers of vengeance and pursuit 170 Back to the gates of heaven: the sulphurous hail
Shot after us in storm, o’erblown hath laid
The fiery surge, that from the precipice
Of heaven received us falling, and the thunder, Winged with red lightning and impetuous rage, Perhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now</div>	
<div>To bellow through the vast and boundless deep. Let us not slip the occasion, whether scorn,
Or satiate fury yield it from our foe.
Seest thou yon dreary plain, forlorn and wild, 180 The seat of desolation, void of light,
Save what the glimmering of these livid flames
Casts pale and dreadful? Thither let us tend
From off the tossing of these fiery waves,
There rest, if any rest can harbour there,
And reassembling our afflicted powers,</div>
